## 🔬 Testing Strategy

### Current Testing Status:
- ✅ Architecture validation test (`test_mvp.py`)
- 🔧 Individual component tests (needed)
- 🔧 Integration tests (needed)
- 🔧 Performance tests (needed)

### Testing Requirements:
1. **Unit Tests**: Test each component independently
2. **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
3. **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete pipelines
4. **Performance Tests**: Validate latency targets
5. **Hardware Tests**: Test on different hardware tiers

## 📋 Immediate Next Steps

### Step 1: Dependency Installation (Priority 1)
```bash
# Install basic dependencies for testing
pip install --user psutil loguru
python test_mvp.py  # Should pass basic architecture tests
```

### Step 2: Create Model Management Branch (Priority 2)
```bash
git checkout -b feature/model-management
